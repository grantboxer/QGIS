The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) published a cartographic
standard for geological map symbolization. This comprehensive document
provides the specifications for a great many symbols used on
geological maps. The document, and associated illustrations and files
can be downloaded from http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/2006/11A02

This document was used to design and define symbols for use by
QGIS. In order to adhere as closely as possible to the specifications
set out in the FGDC document, it was necessary to design a substantial
number of svg symbols and combine these in QGIS to arrive at the
required symbols. Accordingly, a svn folder with a geology subfolder
had to be created to contain all the individual svg files.  It is
necessary to inform QGIS of the location of this folder (this can be
done via the Settings;Options;System;SVG Paths). The combinations of
these svg entities into the actual symbols has been detailed in a
number of .xml files: these can be imported into QGIS via the Style
Manager, using the Share and Import options.

The set of symbols uses some the FGDCGeoAge fonts: the font files can be
obtained from the website http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/2006/11A02

In addition to the FGDC-compliant symbols, there are also 3 additional
.qml files, implementing the colour scheme proposed by the Commission
for the Geological Map of the World (CGMW). The 3 files contain the
colour scheme, and names of respectively the chronostratigraphic
systems, series and stages.
